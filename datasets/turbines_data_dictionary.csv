Key,Value Type,Key Description
case_id,number (integer),Unique stable identification number.
faa_ors,string,Unique identifier for cross-reference to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) digital obstacle files.
faa_asn,string,Unique identifier for cross-reference to the FAA obstruction evaluation airport airspace analysis dataset.
usgs_pr_id,number (integer),Unique identifier for cross-reference to the 2014 USGS turbine dataset.
t_state,string,State where turbine is located.
t_county,string,County where turbine is located.
t_fips,string,State and county fips where turbine is located? based on spatial join of turbine points with US state and county.
p_name,string,Name of the wind power project that the turbine is a part of. Project names are typically provided by the developer; some names are identified via other internet resources? and others are created by the authors to differentiate them from previous projects. Values are that were unknown were assigned a name based on the county where the turbine is located.
p_year,number (integer),Year that the turbine became operational and began providing power. Note this may differ from the year that construction began.
p_tnum,number (integer),Number of turbines in the wind power project.
p_cap,number (float),Cumulative capacity of all turbines in the wind power project in megawatts (MW).
t_manu,string,Turbine manufacturer - name of the original equipment manufacturer of the turbine.
t_model,string,Turbine model - manufacturer's model name of each turbine.
t_cap,number (integer),Turbine rated capacity - stated output power at rated wind speed from manufacturer? ACP? and/or internet resources in kilowatts (kW).
t_hh,number (float),Turbine hub height in meters (m).
t_rd,number (float),Turbine rotor diameter in meters (m).
t_rsa,number (float),Turbine rotor swept area in square meters (m2).
t_ttlh,number (float),Turbine total height from ground to tip of a blade at its apex in meters (m).
retrofit,number (integer),Indicator of whether the turbine has been partially retrofit after initial construction (e.g.? rotor and/or nacelle replacement). 0 indicates no known retrofit. 1 indicates yes known retrofit.
retrofit_year,number (integer),Year in which the turbine was partially retrofit.
t_conf_atr,number (integer),Level of confidence in the turbine attributes. 1â€”No confidence: no attribute data beyond total height and year? 2â€”Partial confidence: incomplete information or substantial conflict between? 3â€”Full confidence: complete information? consistent across multiple data sources.
t_conf_loc,number (integer),Level of confidence in turbine location. 1â€” No turbine shown in image; image has clouds; imagery older than turbine built date? 2â€” Partial confidence: image shows a developed pad with concrete base and/or turbine parts on the ground? 3â€” Full confidence: image shows an installed turbine.
t_img_date,number (integer),Date of image used to visually verify turbine location. Note if source of image is NAIP? the month and day were set to 01/01.
t_img_srce,string,Source of image used to visually verify turbine location.
xlong,number (float),Longitude of the turbine point? in decimal degrees.
ylat,number (float),Latitude of the turbine point? in decimal degrees.
eia_id,number (integer),Plant ID from Energy Information Administration (EIA).
