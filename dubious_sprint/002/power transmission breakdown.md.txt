### 1. Basics of Electric Power Transmission:

- **Electric Power Transmission**: It is the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site, such as a power plant, to an electrical substation. From there, the power is distributed to consumers.

- **AC vs. DC Transmission**: 
  - **AC (Alternating Current)**: This is the most common method for power transmission. However, over long distances, AC can result in more power loss compared to DC.
  - **HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current)**: Especially useful for transmitting power over very long distances or for underwater power cables. HVDC has lower losses over long distances compared to AC.

### 2. Transmission Losses:

- **Definition**: These are the losses (in power) that occur when electricity is transmitted over long distances. They mainly happen due to the resistance of the wires used in power lines.

- **Factors Affecting Losses**: Wire material and thickness, distance, voltage level, and the current itself.

- **Typical Values**: Transmission losses vary, but on average, they can range from 4-12% depending on the distance and technology used.

### 3. Distance and Wind Power:

- Wind farms, especially those located offshore, might be located far from populated areas where the electricity demand exists. This necessitates transmitting power over long distances.

- While there's technically no limit to how far electricity can be transmitted, the further the distance, the greater the losses unless specialized infrastructure (like HVDC) is used.

### 4. Wind Power and Grid Integration:

- **Connection**: Wind farms can either be connected to the main grid or operate in isolation (especially in remote areas).

- **Intermittency**: Wind is intermittent, which can pose challenges to transmission and grid stability. Grid infrastructure needs to accommodate these fluctuations.

### 5. Real-world Examples:

- The **Baltic Cable** between Sweden and Germany, which is around 250 km, uses HVDC technology to transmit power with minimal losses.

- China's **UHVDC lines** transmit renewable energy across distances over 3,000 km with less than 7% in transmission losses.

### 6. Economic and Environmental Implications:

- **Economic**: Building new transmission infrastructure can be expensive. However, using existing infrastructure might result in higher transmission losses.

- **Environmental**: While wind energy is green, building transmission lines can have environmental impacts, e.g., disrupting local habitats.

### 7. Recommendations for Wind Power:

- **Opt for HVDC**: For very long distances, especially from offshore wind farms.
  
- **Grid Storage**: Implementing energy storage solutions can help buffer the intermittent nature of wind, ensuring a stable supply when transmitted.

- **Grid Upgrades**: Modernizing the existing grid to accommodate the specific needs of renewable energy sources, including wind.

In essence, while wind power can be transferred over long distances, careful planning, infrastructure investments, and modern technology are required to do it efficiently. To better understand the practical nuances and intricacies, it might also be helpful to consult with electrical engineers or professionals in the renewable energy sector.
